## Configure AI Providers

1. Launch RikkaHub, click the button on the top left to expand the sidebar.
2. Then click the "Settings" button to enter the settings page.
3. Click the "Providers" button to enter the provider configuration page.
4. This will show the existing providers. If you have the AI provider you need, you can directly enter your API Key. If you don't have the AI provider you need, you can click the plus sign in the upper right corner to add a provider.
5. After adding a provider, you can click the box icon to add a model.

After adding, you can return to the homepage to start using it.

:::tip Tip
If you want to add a provider yourself, note that the Base URL ends with a suffix like `/v1`, for example `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

RikkaHub will add paths like `/chat/completions` to the URL you provide as the request path.
