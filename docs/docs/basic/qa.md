# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is there an iOS version?

No, RikkaHub is an Android application and does not support iOS.

## Will RikkaHub upload my chat history?

No, RikkaHub runs entirely locally and will not upload your chat history.
However, your chats will be sent to the AI provider so that they can return chat results. For specific privacy policies, please refer to the privacy policy of the AI provider you are using.

## Does it support MCP?
